## Loading Packages

```{r setup}
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Loading Boulder Data

```{r}
boulder <- st_read("D:/EAS648/lab_1/boulder_data/BoulderSocialMedia.shp")

boulder
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
